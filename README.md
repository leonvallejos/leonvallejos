## About Me

I am passionate about new and innovative technologies. My main source of learning is reading. Since I was 15 years old I was introduced to programming together with hacking c ++ / c # in games, then when I was 17 I got directly involved with the basics of programming and web application development. Today I aim my career in a study plan oriented to Fullstack Developer, in this way to be able to face any type of development and demonstrate my adaptation capabilities.
