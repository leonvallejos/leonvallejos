## About Me

I am passionate about new and innovative technologies. My main source of learning is reading. Since I was 15 years old I was introduced to programming together with hacking c++ / c# in games, then when I was 17 I got directly involved with the basics of programming and web application development. Today I aim my career in a study plan oriented to Fullstack Developer, in this way to be able to face any type of development and demonstrate my adaptation capabilities.
As a hobby I dedicate myself to hacking on Apple platforms, detecting vulnerabilities in iOS and selling unlocking services for iphone, ipads, ipod, macbook, Apple TV mainly with jailbreak.
